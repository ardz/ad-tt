# answer digital technical assessment

* I've added notes to the code explaining why I've made certain choices.
* Written in .net core 5.0, will need the relevant SDKs on your machine
* All tests will execute in parallel
* Used xBheave for gherkin style in certain places (if needed)
* run “dotnet test” in the e2e\DemoQa.Com_Tests\Tests directory from the command line

## what I've have added if I’d spend more time (had to timebox it to no more than day unfortunately) 😊
* test logging and output (reports?) maybe
